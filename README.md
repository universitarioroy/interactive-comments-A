# InteractiveCommentsA


Hello Community!

In this repository, you will find the source code for the project that solves the challenge presented on the website https://www.frontendmentor.io/; which is named "Interactive comments section". The solution was implemented using HTML5, SCSS, TypeScript, and Angular CLI v16.2.5 technologies. It started from the layout to the functionality, considering both mobile-first and the BEM methodology. Additionally, it handles four breakpoints to make it responsive to mobile devices, tablets, PCs, and high-resolution computers.
